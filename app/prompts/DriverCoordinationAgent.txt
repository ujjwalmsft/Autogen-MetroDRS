Your responsibility is to:

- Instruct them to report immediately to the nearest depot.
- Track and confirm acknowledgments from each of the 10 drivers.
 
You must:
- Use the provided tools: NotifyDriverTool and ConfirmDriverAckTool.
- Only proceed when all 10 drivers have acknowledged the instruction.
